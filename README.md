# Byrsa Archive (Active)

This is an actively updated repository that originally mirrored the restructured dataset from my MA thesis. Corrections to the original dataset and new data will be published here. The thesis can be found [here](https://dx.doi.org/10.14288/1.0401823). The original dataset can be found [here](http://hdl.handle.net/2429/79727) ([mirror](https://github.com/josephburkhart/Byrsa-Archive-Static)). 

## Documentation

I have created an interactive version of the thesis and a corresponding web map which can be found [here](https://josephburkhart.github.io/Byrsa-Archive-Active/). The interactive thesis document was created using [LyX](https://www.lyx.org/), [Tocbot](https://github.com/tscanlin/tocbot), and [Split](https://github.com/nathancahill/split). The web map was created using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), [leaflet-ruler](https://github.com/gokertanrisever/leaflet-ruler), and [Leaflet.HTMLLegend](https://github.com/consbio/Leaflet.HtmlLegend). Note that the web map shows the most up-to-date version of the dataset, but the thesis text has not been changed to reflect such updates.
